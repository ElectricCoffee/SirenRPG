\chapter{Skills} \label{chap:skills}
\section{Introduction}
Skills are the primary workhorse in the game. 
Whenever there's any situation that requires action, a player rolls against their skill plus/minus modifier. 
There are 18 different skills, as seen in figure \ref{fig:skills}. 
These skills reflect the different types of actions a player can perform during play.


\section{Skill Rolls}
The player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) against their skill of choice, if the outcome is $\leq$ the skill level, it's a success, if not, it's a fail.
Rolling a 3, is an automatic success (regardless of level), and rolling an 18 is an automatic fail (also regardless of level).

\paragraph{Example} Say Alice wants to persuade a guard to do something stupid. Her \textit{Persuasion} skill is at 13. 
She rolls 3d6, and rolls a 1, a 5, and a 3, which is 9 in total. This means she successfully persuades the guard.

\section{Proficiency \& Specialisation}
Your character can specialise in any number of different skills.
Specialising grants the skill a \textit{Proficiency Bonus} of $+3$ to that particular specialisation.

\paragraph{Note} Just because your character hasn't specialised in anything, does not mean they cannot perform it, it just means they don't get the proficiency bonus.

\paragraph{Example} Joyce is an Olympic runner, and has a \textit{Constitution} of 5, and an \textit{Agility} of 5; this gives her an \textit{Athletics} score of 10. 
As a runner, she specialises in running, which grants her a $+3$ bonus to her \textit{Athletics} roll whenever she needs to perform a running task.
She rolls 11, but because her effective \textit{Athletics} score is 13 due to the bonus, she succeeds.

\section{Skills in Depth}
\subsection{Mental Skills}
\subsubsection{Academics (Int + Int)}
The Academics skill, called \textit{Knowledge}, or \textit{Lore} in other games, is the skill of knowing things factually. 
This can be things your character has read, or something they've researched.
If your character needs to identify ancient writing, source herbs, design circuits, or have a meaningful discussion with an expert, this is the go-to skill.

\subsubsection{Healing (Int + Wis)}
This is the ability to heal others by any means, whether it be by first aid, advanced medicine, magic, or healing herbs, you name it. 

\paragraph{Note} This is different from \textit{Academics/Medicine} which is the scientific knowledge about medicine, rather than its practical application, though there is a fair bit of overlap. 
\textit{Medicine} may be used in cases where \textit{Healing} would otherwise apply, if the character is sufficient enough with the skill.

Investigation is the skill of actively searching for things and gathering information.
Whether your character is hunting for clues or digging through books, investigation is the skill to use.

\subsubsection{Persuasion (Cha + Wis)}
Persuasion is the skill for manipulating people for good or bad.

\section{Contest of Skills}\label{sec:contest}
Situations arise, when your character needs to test their skills and prove their worth, this is done via a \textit{Contest of Skills}.
These contests come in three different variants: \textit{Passive}, \textit{Active}, and \textit{Tournament}.

\subsection{Passive Contest}
A passive contest arises when the character needs to overcome some passive obstacle. This could be things like walking a tightrope, picking a lock, leaping over a gap, etc.
The GM silently decides the level of difficulty by announcing a skill +/- a modifier that needs to be rolled.

\paragraph{Example} Astrid is running from her pursuers across the rooftops of ancient Rome, she needs to clear a particularly wide gap between the buildings. Astrid says \textit{``I'm jumping the gap''}, to which the GM replies \textit{``Roll Athletics -2''}. Astrid's Athletics skill is at 11, at -2, she must roll 9 or less to succeed. She rolls an 8 and gracefully leaps between the buildings.

\subsection{Active Contest}
An active contest is when the character is up against someone or something that actively works against them. Be it trying to pick-pocket a guard, an intense sword-fight, or playing chess against an opponent; all of this providing an \textit{active} resistance.

In an active contest, both parties roll against their most applicable skill, the outcome is judged as follows:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    \textbf{Character A} & \textbf{Character B} & \textbf{Winner}\\\hline
    Fail & Fail & The one failing by least \\
    Fail & Success & Character B \\
    Success & Fail & Character A \\
    Success & Success & The one succeeding by most
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
If no one fails or succeeds more than the opponent, re-roll.

\paragraph{Example} Tom wants to sneak past a guard, Tom's \textit{Stealth} is at 9, he rolls 11, failing by 2 degrees. 
The guard's \textit{Perception} is at 10, but rolls 13, failing by 3 degrees. 
Tom failed less than the guard, thus successfully sneaking past the guard.

\subsection{Tournaments}
Tournaments are \textit{longer} contests of skills.
Tournaments are divided into rounds, whoever wins the most rounds wins the tournament.
Each individual round is a regular \textit{active contest}.
