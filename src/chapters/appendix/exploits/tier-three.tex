\section{Tier Three}

\subsection*{Blooddrunk (3 XP)}
\textit{``...Leave the hunting of hunters to me.''}\\
When in melee combat, a roll of 4 or lower counts as an automatic success.

\subsection*{Machine Specialist (3 XP)}
\textit{If it has moving parts, you can figure it out.}\\
You can use \textit{Crafting} instead of \textit{Investigation} to deduce how any machine works regardless of prior familiarity.

\subsection*{Mac's Back (3 XP)}
\textit{``The best way to beat a problem is to make it work for you.''}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} At least one \textit{Crafting} specialisation.

When deprived of the correct tools, materials, and/or workspace you are still able to make crafting checks so long as you are able to give an explanation to the GM of how your character did so.
Additionally, the maximum penalty on any \textit{Crafting} check is now $-2$.

\subsection*{Right Behind You (3 XP)}
\textit{"And worst of all, he could be any one of us..."}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} \textit{Now you See Me, Now You Don't}.

Get a $+2$ bonus on \textit{Stealth} when trying to blend into a crowd.
If wearing a disguise, you instead get a $+4$ bonus.

\subsection*{Red Tape Splicer (3 XP)}
\textit{You get up early, stay up late. You use a machete to cut through red tape.}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} \textit{Red Tape Recorder}.

Unconditional re-roll on \textit{Persuasion} against a government official.
Doing so damages your reputation with that agency.
(Removing this condition increases the cost to 4 XP.)

\subsection*{Uncanny Dodge (3 XP)}
\textit{Your dodging is almost preternatural!}\\
\textbf{Requirements:} \textit{Lucky Dodge}.

Once per day, you may re-roll \textit{another} one of your unfavourable dice when trying to dodge.
You may either re-roll one die during two different encounters, or two dice during one encounter.
