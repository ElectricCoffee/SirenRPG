\chapter{Example Exploits}\label{app:exploits}
Trying to come up with new exploits in the heat of the moment can be hard.
This appendix exists to alleviate this pain and get the proverbial juices flowing!

Note that this by no means is an exhaustive list!
More can be added to fit the given campaign.
Also note that exploits should be limited somehow, so as to not be over-powered. What it means to be over-powered depends on context and setting. See Section~\ref{sec:exploit-balance} for exploit balancing.
