\chapter{Example Exploits}\label{app:exploits}
Trying to come up with new exploits in the heat of the moment can be hard.
This appendix exists to alleviate this pain and get the proverbial juices flowing!

Note that this by no means is an exhaustive list!
More can be added to fit the given campaign.
Also note that exploits must always be limited in their use, so as to not be too over-powered.

\section{Backstab}
You can attack with \textit{Stealth} instead of \textit{Fighting} provided your target isn't already aware of your presence.

\section{Body Builder}
You can use \textit{Physique} instead of \textit{Persuasion} to distract people with your muscles.

\section{De-Trapper}
Once per game you may re-roll your least favourable die when disarming traps.

\section{Desert Dweller}
You can instinctively search for food in a desert.
You can therefore use $Con + Wis$ instead of $Con + Int$ when looking for food with \textit{Desert Survival}.

\section{Intimidating Size}
You are big and burly and your size can come across as threatening.
You can use $Cha + Str$ instead of $Cha + Wis$ to intimidate someone.

\section{Machine Specialist}
You can use \textit{Crafting} instead of \textit{Investigation} to deduce how a machine works by studying it.

\section{Master Strategist}
Your training made you good at drawing plans.
Get a $+2$ bonus on \textit{Academics} when drawing up a strategy.

\section{Red Tape Recorder}
You're fluent in government lingo, you can therefore use $Int + Int$ instead of $Cha + Cha$ when trying to persuade government officials.
