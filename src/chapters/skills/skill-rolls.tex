\section{Skill Rolls}
The player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) against their skill of choice, if the outcome is $\leq$ the skill level, it's a success, if not, it's a fail.
Rolling a 3, is an automatic success (regardless of level), and rolling an 18 is an automatic fail (also regardless of level).

\paragraph{Example} Say Alice wants to persuade a guard to do something stupid. Her \textit{Persuasion} skill is at 13. 
She rolls 3d6, and rolls a 1, a 5, and a 3, which is 9 in total. This means she successfully persuades the guard.
