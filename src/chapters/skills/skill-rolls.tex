\section{Skill Rolls}
The player rolls three six-sided dice (3d6) against their skill of choice, if the outcome is $\leq$ the skill level, it's a success, if not, it's a fail.
Rolling a 3, is an automatic success (regardless of level), and rolling an 18 is an automatic fail (also regardless of level).

\paragraph{Example} Alice wants to pick a lock. 
Her \textit{Thievery} skill is at 13. 
She rolls 3d6, and rolls a 1, a 5, and a 3, which is 9 in total. 
This means she successfully picks the lock.

\subsection{Skill Modifiers \& Challenge Ratings}
A skill modifier is something which modifies a skill.
These modifiers always come in the form $Skill \pm n$, where $n$ is by how much a given skill is modified.

Skill modifiers can be applied in a variety of situations and almost always stack.
Modifiers can come from your character's specialisations (see Section~\ref{sec:specialisation}), their exploits (see Chapter~\ref{chap:exploits}), the difficulty of a given challenge, fatigue (see Section~\ref{sec:fatigue-points}), or various status effects.

Pushing a boulder could be $\mathit{Physique} - 4$, which means it \textit{subtracts} 4 from your character's Physique skill ($\pm$ any other modifiers) \textbf{before} the roll is performed, thus making it more difficult to succeed.

\paragraph{Note to players coming from other systems} The skill system may be reversed from what you're used to, and may require some re-adjustment time because in Siren you want to be aiming for a lower roll.
