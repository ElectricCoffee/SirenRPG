\section{Skills in Depth}
\subsection{Mental Skills}
\subsubsection{Academics (Int + Int)}
The Academics skill, called \textit{Knowledge}, or \textit{Lore} in other games, is the skill of knowing things factually. 
This can be things your character has read, or something they've researched.
If your character needs to identify ancient writing, source herbs, design circuits, or have a meaningful discussion with an expert, this is the go-to skill.
