\section{Proficiency Bonus \& Specialisation}
Your character can specialise in any number of different skills.
Specialising grants the skill a \textit{Proficiency Bonus} equal to the level of proficiency you have bought for that particular specialisation.
See Chapter~\ref{chap:char-prog} for more info.

\paragraph{Note} Just because your character hasn't specialised in anything, does not mean they cannot perform it, it just means they don't get the proficiency bonus.

\paragraph{Example} Joyce is an Olympic runner, and has a \textit{Constitution} of 5, and an \textit{Agility} of 5; this gives her an \textit{Athletics} score of 10. 
As a runner, her specialisation in running grants her a $+2$ proficiency bonus to her \textit{Athletics} roll whenever she needs to perform a running task.
She rolls 11, but because her effective \textit{Athletics} score is 12 due to the bonus, she succeeds.
