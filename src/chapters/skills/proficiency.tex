\section{Specialisation}\label{sec:specialisation}
Your character can specialise in any number of different skills.
Specialising grants the skill a \textit{Skill Modifier} equal to the level of proficiency you have bought for that particular specialisation.
This modifier on the given skill only applies if that specialisation is used.
This means there's a difference between using a skill specialised and unspecialised.
See Chapter~\ref{chap:char-prog} for more info on how to acquire and upgrade specialisations.

\begin{note} 
    Just because your character hasn't specialised in anything, does not mean they cannot perform it, it just means they don't get the skill modifier.
\end{note}

\begin{example}
    Joyce is an Olympic runner, and has a \textit{Constitution} of 5, and an \textit{Agility} of 5; this gives her an \textit{Athletics} score of 10. 
    As a runner, her specialisation in running grants her a $+2$ modifier to her \textit{Athletics} roll whenever she needs to perform a running task.
    She rolls 11, but because her effective \textit{Athletics} score is 12 due to the modifier, she succeeds.
\end{example}
