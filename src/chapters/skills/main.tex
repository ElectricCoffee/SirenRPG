\chapter{Skills} \label{chap:skills}
\section{Introduction}
Skills are the primary workhorse in the game. 
Whenever there's any situation that requires action, a player rolls against their skill plus/minus modifier. 
There are 20 different skills, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:skills}. 
These skills reflect the different types of actions a player can perform during play.

\paragraph{Note} The skills listed are a guideline, and may not fit the setting. 
Therefore, it's up to the GM to add, replace, or remove any skills on the list if it's relevant to the given game or setting.
