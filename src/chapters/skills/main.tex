\section{Introduction}
Skills are the primary workhorse in the game. 
Whenever there's any situation that requires action, a player rolls against their skill plus/minus modifier. 
There are 19 different skills, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:skills}. 
These skills reflect the different types of actions a player can perform during play.
