\chapter{Defence \& Damage Resistance}\label{chap:defence}
\section{Introduction}
Let's face it, taking damage isn't fun, but unfortunately, it's a natural and almost unavoidable consequence of combat.
Luckily, there are ways to avoid, or at least mitigate some of the damage taken.
For this, there are three different things that might help you out: damage resistance, and active and passive defence.

\section{Active Defence}
Active defence (AD), is performed by your character during combat.
This refers to actions like dodging, blocking, or parrying an attack.
More often than not, active defences have a very low chance of success, but also have a very high reward, as they make it possible to completely avoid all damage from an attack.

There are two things a character can do when actively defending:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Dodge.} Roll against your \textit{Move} trait.
    \item \textbf{Parry.} Roll against half of your weapon skill, rounded down.
\end{enumerate}
You get an additional $+2$ to your roll if you also choose to move out of the way of the attack.

\section{Passive Defence}
Passive defence (PD), is defence gained from your armour.
Generally, thicker armour usually grants a bigger passive defence bonus.
The passive defence is added to your active defence score when performing a defence roll.

\paragraph{Example} Jean has been challenged by a rival clan's champion, who is charging at him, claymore raised high.
Jean's dodge is 6, his leather armour and buckler give him 1 PD each.
Added together, it gives him an effective defence of 8, which he then needs to roll against to evade the foe.
He rolls an 8! He slips right past his opponent, deflecting the claymore with his buckler.

\section{Damage Resistance}
Damage resistance (DR), is something that always applies, whether your character is aware of the attack or not.
Damage resistance is granted by certain armour, shields, and potions, and reduce some of the damage your character takes when hit.
Simply put: if your character has 2 points of damage resistance, then they take 2 points of damage fewer than they otherwise would.

\paragraph{Example} The Champion turns around, and faces Jean once more before charging at him again.
Jean doesn't make his dodge, and takes a cut from the claymore.
The claymore dealt 5 points of damage!
But luckily, because of the leather armour's one point of damage resistance, Jean only suffered 4 points of damage.
