\section{Phases}\label{sec:phases}
Turns in Siren is split into two distinct phases: \textit{Proactive} and \textit{Reactive}.

The phases are structured as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Proactive 
  \item Reactive
  \item Damage Calculation (if applicable)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Proactive Phase}
The proactive phase is what you would think of as ``your turn'', during your proactive phase you can pick any two of the following actions: \textit{Moving}, \textit{Bracing}, or \textit{Attacking}.
If however, your character is performing a non-combat action (such as picking a lock), this takes up the entire proactive phase.

\paragraph{Move}
Movement means your character can move up to half their speed-rating.

\paragraph{Brace}
Your character takes a defensive stance and gets $+2$ to any defence rolls this turn.

\paragraph{Attack}
You character gets to roll an attack.

If your character performs a ranged attack, you need to check the weapon's range.
The skill check to attack is done at $-3$ for every time the range of the weapon is exceeded.

\paragraph{Ranged Attack Example} Will the Ranger is out hunting for his party. He spots a deer in the distance. His bow has a range of 100 metres, the deer is 300 metres away. This exceeds the bow's range twice ($2\times -3$ penalty). Will must roll $Longbow-6$ to succeed.

\paragraph{Note} In the proactive phase, your character can pick the same option twice.

\subsection{Reactive Phase}
When your character is being attacked, they enter the reactive phase.
During this phase, you can choose any \textbf{one} of either \textit{Moving}, \textit{Defending}, \textit{Counter-Attacking}

\paragraph{Move}
Movement means your character can move up to half their speed-rating.

\paragraph{Defend}
Your character is able to perform a defensive roll + any cumulative modifiers from their previous proactive phase.

Note that this means if you didn't move or brace yourself in the previous turn, you don't get the relevant bonuses.

\paragraph{Counter-Attack}
Instead of moving or defending, you may simply initiate an attack in response.
