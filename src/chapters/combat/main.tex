\chapter{Combat}\label{chap:combat}
\section{Introduction}
Combat is a staple of most RPGs. 
It's intense, often exhilarating, and it gives the players a chance to strategise.
Combat is essentially a series of \textit{Contests of Skill} (see Section~\ref{sec:contest}), but due to the nature of combat are naturally a bit more involved.

\subsection{Turns}
Combat is split into a number of turns, each turn represents about 6 seconds of in-game time, meaning 10 turns make up an in-game minute.

Each character's individual turn is split into two types of phases: \textit{proactive} and \textit{reactive}.
See Section~\ref{sec:phases} for details.

\note One turn is the time it takes for every character to have had a go, not the time for each individual character.

\subsection{Turn Order}
To determine turn order, each player rolls $1d6 + \mathit{Athletics}$. 
The turn-order is then ordered highest to lowest. 
Highest result goes first, lowest goes last. 
Any ties require a re-roll.

\example Alice, Bob, and Clarice all roll for turn order. 
They have an athletics score of 9, 9, and 10 respectively. 
Alice rolls a 5, Bob rolls 3, and Clarice rolls a 6. 
Clarice goes first with 16, Alice is next with 14, and Bob is last with a score of 12.

\subsection{Movement}\label{sec:movement}
Particularly, the characters rely on their movement points to move about the battle mat.
Movement is 8-directional (see Figure~\ref{fig:directions}), and moving in any direction costs 1 movement point.

Your character can only move as far as their movement points allow, but you may choose to move a shorter distance if you so desire.
Figure~\ref{fig:movement} shows an example of a character moving 4 squares, which is worth 4 movement points.

\subsection{The Grid}
The battle mat is subdivided into a grid of squares. 
The in-game size of a square is $1m^2$, although the GM may scale it up or down as necessary.
The GM must alert the players of the scale if it differs from the standard $1m^2$.
