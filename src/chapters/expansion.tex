\chapter{Expanding Siren}
\section{Introduction}
Over the course of this book, we have often been writing things like ``It is up to the GM to decide that...'', or ``if this doesn't fit your setting, you're free to...'', etc.
This chapter will serve as a guideline for how to expand the rules of Siren as an RPG engine, and perhaps give you some ideas.

Everything in Siren is meant to be changed, expanded, or modified in some way to better suit the game you want to play.
If the \textit{Skill} listing doesn't fit your epic space adventure, then it can be changed.
If you think \textit{Faith} really needs to be a \textit{Trait}, then you can add it.
Only your imagination sets the limit!
