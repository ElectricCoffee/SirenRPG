\chapter{Traits}
\section{Introduction}
Traits are the aspects that define your character. These are things like their brains, their brawn, their fitness, etc. There are two different types of Traits in the game: \textit{Core Traits}, and \textit{Derived Traits}, which are special Traits derived from the core ones.
\section{Core Traits}
There are 7 core traits, each with an associated three-letter abbreviation.
Traits have an associated score, the score determines how good or bad your character will be at certain tasks during the game. You can find the core traits in figure \ref{fig:core_traits}.

    \begin{tabular}{r | l}
        \textbf{Trait}  & \textbf{Description} \\\hline
        Agility      ($Agi$) & Movement and reaction \\
        Charisma     ($Cha$) & Ability to affect people \\
        Constitution ($Con$) & Health, stamina, and mettle \\
        Dexterity    ($Dex$) & Use of your hands and fingers \\
        Intelligence ($Int$) & Mental capability \\
        Strength     ($Str$) & Raw strength and muscle power \\
        Wisdom       ($Wis$) & Situational assessment and intuition
    \end{tabular}

\section{Derived Traits}
The derived traits are all based on the core traits, and therefore cannot be chosen. You can find the derived traits on figure \ref{fig:derived_traits}.

\begin{tabular}{r | l}
    \textbf{Trait} & \textbf{Calculation} \\\hline
    Fatigue ($FP$) & $Str+Con$ \\
    Health  ($HP$) & $Con\times 2$ \\
    Mana    ($MP$) & $Int\times Wis$ \\
    Parry          & $Fighting/2$, rounded down\\
    Speed \& Dodge & $Athletics / 2$, rounded down\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Trait Saves}
Sometimes when a situation calls for it, you need to roll what's called a \textit{Trait Save}.
Trait saves are where you roll against your trait rather than your skill to affect the outcome of a certain situation.

A trait save is always $2 \times \mathit{affected\ trait}$, regardless of the trait.
Trait saves are different from \textit{Skill Rolls} (see chapter \ref{chap:skills}) in that they only make use of a single trait, and are not subject to modifiers.

\paragraph{Example} Mark is on the brink of collapse.
He's lost a lot of blood in the battle against the mob boss.
His \textit{Constitution} is at 6, and needs to roll a \textit{Constitution Save} ($Con \times 2 = 12$) to not faint from blood loss.
He rolls a 2, a 6, and a 5, a total of 13. He collapses and faints.
