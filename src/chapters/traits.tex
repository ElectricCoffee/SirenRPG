\chapter{Traits}
\section{Introduction}
Traits are the aspects that define your character. These are things like their brains, their brawn, their fitness, etc. There are two different types of Traits in the game: \textit{Core Traits}, and \textit{Derived Traits}, which are special Traits derived from the core ones.
\section{Core Traits}
There are 7 core traits, each with an associated three-letter abbreviation.
Traits have an associated score, the score determines how good or bad your character will be at certain tasks during the game. You can find the core traits in figure \ref{fig:core_traits}.

\section{Derived Traits}
The derived traits are all based on the core traits, and therefore cannot be chosen. You can find the derived traits on figure \ref{fig:derived_traits}.
