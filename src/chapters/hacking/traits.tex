\section{Adding or Changing Traits}
Your setting may not be satisfied with just the seven basic traits included in the core rules.
It could be that you feel it would be better with an eighth trait like \textit{Faith} or \textit{Psionics} or something else entirely.
Maybe you instead prefer combining some of the traits into broader categories, like combining \textit{Int} and \textit{Wis} into a joined \textit{Mental} trait.
It's all doable, should you want to do so.
Just keep in mind: it's easier to add traits than to remove or combine them, since the latter will inevitably require you to rewrite many of the \textit{Skills} to fit the new listing.
