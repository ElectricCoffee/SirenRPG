\section{Changing the Core Mechanics}
Sometimes the basic rules themselves don't fit what you really wish to achieve.
If you wish to shake up the number or type of dice used for the system, you can do so; just be prepared that you may need to re-balance or even change the \textit{Skill} system entirely.

Maybe you instead wish to change the system from rolling \textit{under} a given rating to \textit{over}---similar to how it's done in many other RPG systems.
You can do that of course, but given how fundamental this style of rolling is to how the engine is constructed, it may be a difficult task.

\subsection{Example Changes}
\paragraph{Hex-Grid} A rather simple change could be to use a hex-grid instead of a square one for combat.
Movement will be restricted to six directions instead of eight, and some care will have to be put into calculating distances.

\paragraph{Polyhedral Damage Dice} Maybe you want your great-axe to use a $d12$ as a damage die instead of $2d6$, or let the spear use a $d4$ instead of $d6-1$.

\paragraph{Action Points} Instead of having combat run in phases, it could instead use Action Points.
Each character has $AP$ equal to their speed, and may carry out any number of proactive or reactive actions as long as there's enough $AP$ to do it.
