\chapter{Hacking Siren}
\section{Introduction}
Over the course of this book, we have often been writing things like \textit{``It is up to the GM to decide that...''}, or \textit{``if this doesn't fit your setting, you're free to...''}, etc.
This chapter will serve as a guideline for how to expand the rules of Siren as an RPG engine, and perhaps give you some ideas.

Siren Core is written as generic as possible in order to hit as wide as target as possible in terms of genres.
Naturally this also means not everything in this book will necessarily fit your goals as a GM, and that's okay.
Everything in Siren is meant to be changed, expanded, or modified in some way to better suit the game you want to play.
If the \textit{Skill} listing doesn't fit your epic space adventure, then it can be changed.
If you think \textit{Faith} really needs to be a \textit{Trait}, then you can add it.
Only your imagination sets the limit!

\begin{note}
    This chapter will not go into how to add \textit{Exploits} or \textit{Spells}.
    Please refer to the relevant chapters for information on that.
