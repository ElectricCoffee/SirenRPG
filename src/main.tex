\section*{What is Siren?}
Siren, the \textbf{Si}mple \textbf{R}PG \textbf{En}gine, is a free and open source RPG system that aims at being simple and easy to learn without also compromising on the expressiveness of the system.

An RPG engine, much like a video game engine, is a framework on which you can build your own system. If any of the rules in this seem like they don't \textit{quite} fit what you need, you're free to change them or even add new ones if that better suits your campaign.

\section*{What are RPGs?}
Role Playing Games---RPGs for short---are games in which you take the role of some character and act in their stead.
You may know this from video games, where you play some adventurer in a medieval land full of magic and dragons; or where you play a person that's trying to survive in a nuclear wasteland, fighting mutants and warring factions.
But RPGs date back before that.

Traditional RPGs, also known as \textit{Tabletop RPGs} or \textit{Pen and Paper RPGs} date back to the early 1970s.
It's a social game played with a group of friends around a table, mutually telling a common story of great adventure, mysticism, space warfare or anything else they can come up with.
These typically employ the use of dice and a piece of paper with all the characters' traits and abilities written out for the players to make use of during game-play.

\section*{Who is this for?}
Some role-playing systems have hundreds of books and rules, so many so that it's hard to remember them all, and valuable playtime is spent researching and cros-referencing rules. 
While other systems have so few and vague, that a lot of playtime is spent arguing about which rules apply to a given situation.

Siren is made for those players who wish to have a small yet precise set of rules that can be used in every type of story, whether it's a grand space opera, or high fantasy, Siren's got you covered.

\section*{Conventions}
This book uses standard RPG dice notation, which looks like this: $AdX\pm L$, where $A$ is the number of dice, $X$ is the number of faces on the die, and $L$ is the value added or subtracted after the roll, so $3d6+8$ means roll three six-sided dice, and add 8 to the result.
While any type of die can be used in your games, Siren only requires the venerable $d6$.

\note Notes are displayed like this, and often convey important information to the player or GM regarding a certain mechanic.

\example Examples are displayed like this, and show a situation in which something is used.
